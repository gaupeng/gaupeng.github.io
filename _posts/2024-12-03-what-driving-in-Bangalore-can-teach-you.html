<p>
    You always hear people complaining about how terrible driving in Bangalore is, but let's look at the brighter side.
    Here are a few positives we can take from navigating our beautiful streets and how they can inspire you in the
    coming year.</p>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Be ready to swerve — not all speed-breakers have reflectors, and some might not even be painted for you to spot
        them.
        You also couldn't have expected the cyclist to try to cut across the road when you were going about your lane.
        However,
        this is just a lesson that life presents you with moments where you need to swerve gracefully, dodge those
        obstacles,
        and go on your way.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learn to ignore the noise — there will always be noise on the roads. Construction sounds, impatient honks, and
        loud
        music from processions are lessons to teach you that you need to learn to ignore the noise on your journey.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remember that life is like a̶ ̶r̶o̶l̶l̶e̶r̶c̶o̶a̶s̶t̶e̶r̶ Bellandur Lake Road — it will have its ups
        (speedbreakers),
        downs (potholes), and occasionally you will have nobody to guide you (no street lights), but if you are careful
        and
        confident, you will find your way to your destination.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learn to change paths — on a similar note, sometimes Bellandur Lake Road is closed. Remember there are always
        many ways
        to get to your destination, no matter how much longer or inefficient another route might be. You will eventually
        reach
        your destination.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be accepting, even when it is not your fault — sure the two-wheeler almost knocked you onto the street as it
        drove down
        the footpath, but maybe some people don't know better.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you're wrong, be confident — Driving on the wrong side? Honk at them like it's their fault. Breaking signals?
        Glare
        at them like red is the new green. Confidence will get you places following rules could never have.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your own way, even if it's wrong — there will be people who will tell you there is a right way to do things
        (such
        as following rules or sticking to your side of the road). What these people don't know is that they are simply
        following
        the herd, and it's way more fun finding your own way on your journey.
    </li>
    <li>
        Expect the unexpected — you have to look both ways when crossing even a one-way. Sometimes, you even have to
        look up.
        Make sure you're ready for everything.
    </li>
    <li>
        Good things take time — would we really appreciate the metro if it had been built in a week? Often, it is
        difficult to
        see the end result when the journey is long, but the result is always fulfilling.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus on the good — sure the traffic is bad, the roads barely exist and rules are optional, but hey, at least
        the
        weather is good. Remember that it could always be worse.
    </li>
    <li>
        Think like an auto driver — ever wondered how an auto fit in the gap that you were sure even a cycle could not
        have?
        Dream big, and it shall happen. It's only impossible till it's not done.
    </li>

        Be like Dubbu — this one is my favorite and has a bit of a story.
        My friend Dhiraj (Dubbu) and I were once driving down the streets of Indiranagar in his car. As we momentarily
        paused
        due to traffic, we suddenly felt a small bump and our car took a small jump forward.
        “Did we just get rear-ended?” I asked Dubbu.
        “Yep!” he said, and we continued onwards with no other conversation around it.
        Later, when we got out and inspected the car, Dubbu, scratching his beard, asked me “Which one do you think it
        is?”
        I looked at the 30-odd dents and scratches on his rear bumper and shrugged.
        So be like Dubbu — learn to let go.
